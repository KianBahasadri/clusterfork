# Clusterfork

Multi-agent orchestration framework for AI-driven software development. Hierarchical architecture (human → orchestrator → managers → workers) with budget enforcement and model routing.

## Status: Shelved

After six proposals and twelve literature reviews, the core problem (building webapps fast without surprise LLM bills) turned out to be solved by provider-level spending caps and existing tools (Claude Code, Cursor, CrewAI). See [`007_Reality_Check.md`](research/proposals/007_Reality_Check.md).
