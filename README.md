# Clusterfork

> **Burn LLM credits at the speed of light.**

Clusterfork is my **large-scale autonomous agent system**. I'm designing the orchestration layer for the next generation of software development, where **vibe coding** meets industrial-scale execution. My goal is to build a framework that lets me code up projects and ideas with industrial-grade reliability and parallelism.

## 🎯 Intention & Aim

I'm moving beyond single-agent loops to create a **hierarchical network of autonomous agents**—workers, managers, and decision-makers—that think, plan, and execute together.

My core goals are:

1.  **Orchestration at Scale**: Managing swarms of specialized agents (coders, reviewers, architects) working in parallel on a shared codebase.
2.  **Robust Autonomy**: Building systems that can handle long-running tasks, recover from failures, and manage their own state (inspired by concepts like "Gas Town" and LangGraph).
3.  **Vibe Coding, Industrialized**: Enabling a workflow where high-level intent is rapidly translated into code by a fleet of agents, turning software development into a high-throughput manufacturing process.

## 📂 Repository Structure

-   `research/literature review/`: Analyses of existing papers and frameworks.
-   `research/proposals/`: Design documents and specifications for Clusterfork.
